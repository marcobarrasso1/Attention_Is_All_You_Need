# Attention_Is_All_You_Need
My Pytorch implementation of the "Attention Is All You Need" Transformer.<br>
Paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762" target="_blank">Attention_Is_All_You_Need<a>

In this repo i tried to reproduce the transformer model from the paper and use it to make some translation from English-to-Italian. The Transformer architecture can be found in the [model.py](model.py) file.
